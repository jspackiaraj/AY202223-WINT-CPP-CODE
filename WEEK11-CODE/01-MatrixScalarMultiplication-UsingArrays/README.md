# Question #
Write a C++ program that reads a file containing the data required to populate a matricx, which will be multiplied by a constant.  The first two rows of the data files have the data of the number of rows and columns, respectively.  The remaining rows have the data arranged so that the matrix can be populated in a row-wise fashion.  Your program should get the file name to be read from the user and the constant multiplying factor respectively. These values are expected to be used to populate dynamic arrays, which will be added.
The program will also be required to print the output in the same fashion as the input file, i.e. print the number of rows and columns in the first line, and the rest of the elements of the matrix can be in a row-wise fashion.
