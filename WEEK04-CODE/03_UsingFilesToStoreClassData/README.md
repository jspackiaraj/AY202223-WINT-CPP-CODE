Another method shall read the data that you have written and print the name of the player with the highest score.
## About the proposed solution ##
A proposed solution has been attached.  Please refer to the previous programs for the cavets of file handling
## Outline of Solution ##
Here is an outline of the steps you can follow to find the surface area and volume of a sphere:
1. Start by creating an object to store the data
2. Crete the file object, with an __ofstream__ object, the file will be opened so that it can be written to.
3. Write to the file just as how you would write to console using __cout__.  In this case, it is advantageous to use the pointer to the object and write the data to the file.
> **Note**
> The file created has the datatype of the members of the class also stored.  Open the file in a text editor and check it up. 
## Availability of the program ##
The proposed solution will be available after __07 Jan 2023__
