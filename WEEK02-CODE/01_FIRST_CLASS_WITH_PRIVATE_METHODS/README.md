# FIRST CLASS WITH PRIVATE METHODS #

Write a C++ class Human with a public member variable __name__ and a private member variable __age__ of data types string and int, respectively.

Create public methods __IntroduceSelf()__, __SetAge()__ and,__GetAge()__.  

The public method __IntroduceSelf()__ will use __name__ and print.

>Hi, My Name is __name__ 

followed by a newline character.

The public method, __SetAge()__, will accept one argument of datatype int and set the private member variable __age__ with the value it receives.

The public method,__GetAge()__, will return the value stored in the private member __age__ with the following logic.  If the __age__ is more than 30, it will return the value after reducing by 2; otherwise, it will just return the value of __age__.

Write the main function with an instance of the class human, which will set the name of the human and use the __SetAge()__ method to set the age.  Call the __IntroduceSelf()__ method from the function main() and print 

>Age of firstMan  __use exposed method GetAge() to print age__

followed by a newline
