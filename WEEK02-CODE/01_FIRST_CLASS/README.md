# First Class #
In this exercise, a class has been created, and the methods have been used.  A class does work.  In this case, the work done is printing some text using the members of the class.


A typical question would be:


Write a C++ class Human with two public member variables __name__ and __age__ of data types string and int, respectively.  Write a public method __IntroduceSelf()__ which will use __name__ and __age__ and print.


>Hi, My Name is __name__ and am __age__ years old 

with a newline character at the end.
